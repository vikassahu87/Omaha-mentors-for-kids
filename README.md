# Omaha-mentors-for-kids

Omaha Mentors for Kids was a pprojrct that we did as part of my graduate course.
OMK was a non-profit that worked to keep the not so bright kids in school.
They held interaction with the students through assigned.
OMK required a web portal to upload all the student and mentor related data for better monitoring.
